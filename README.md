# Important:

**When you install the servers, please make sure that, the passwords are updated in the files that require a connection to database.**

## Notes:

1. First thing first, go and download all the Microsoft© C++ Redistributables, based on the CPU’s Arch. If the system has a 64bit Arch. I suggest that you download both the 32bit as well as the 64bit versions of the Microsoft© C++ Redistributables.
2. Next, install either WAMP© Server or download Bitnami’s WAMP Server (Recommended).
3. While setting up, both the installers will ask, the MySQL database’s root password, set it as you like and remember it.
4. Now place the folders under the Apache server’s root directory “HTDOCS”.
5. Open up your favorite web browser, and type in “http://localhost/ProjectName”.
6. Before operating, load the database files for smooth operation.
